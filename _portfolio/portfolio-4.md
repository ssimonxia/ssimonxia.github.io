The application of UR3 Robot Arms has significantly expanded across various industrial sectors due to their versatility, ease of programming, and capability to work collaboratively alongside humans. These robotic systems are increasingly employed for tasks such as human assistance, laboratory automation, product design validation, and quality control in manufacturing processes. This project investigates a specific use case of UR3 Robot Arms, focusing on their ability to assist human operators by transferring tools of varying sizes and shapes. The study involves the integration of a UR3 Robot Arm with a camera system to capture detailed information about the tools and their spatial positions. We developed and implemented a real-time algorithm designed to classify tools based on their geometric features, determine optimal pick-up points, and precisely deliver them to human hands. The algorithm's efficacy is assessed through its performance in classifying diverse tools, selecting accurate pick-up points, positioning tools in human hands with precision, and maintaining operational continuity. This research highlights the potential applications of UR3 Robot Arms in enhancing human work efficiency and suggests practical use cases for these robots in industrial environments.
