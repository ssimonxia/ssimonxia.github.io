title: "Keylogger with Large Language Model"
excerpt: "<p> Nowadays, the outputs generated by computer recording tools, such as keylogger, are voluminous and complicated. Authorized users often spend subtantial time and effort in extracting useful and comprehensive information from these output logs. To address this challenge, large language models, known for their robust text analysis capabilities, offer a promising solution to improve both quality and efficiency of data analysis. This project seeks to investigate the potential and efficacy of LLMs in optimizing the analysis of keylogger results, aiming to improve the overall effectiveness of interpreting and leveraging recorded data. </p> <iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/BSj2QhuCH9k' frameborder='0' allow='autoplay; encrypted-media' allowfullscreen></iframe>"

In the digital age, the need for sophisticated tools to monitor and analyze computer activities has become increasingly critical. This project presents the development of an advanced keylogger designed using the Rust programming language, aimed at capturing comprehensive data from computer systems, including file interactions, user actions, and keystrokes. The keylogger incorporates innovative algorithms to filter and highlight potentially sensitive information, thereby minimizing the necessity for exhaustive manual review by unauthorized users. To further obfuscate the collected data from computer owners, encryption and decryption algorithms were implemented, ensuring secure handling and retrieval of the logs. Motivated by recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), the project integrates these models to enhance the analysis of keylogger outputs, providing more nuanced and accurate interpretations of the captured data. This project underscores the significance of leveraging advanced technologies to improve data capture and analysis.
