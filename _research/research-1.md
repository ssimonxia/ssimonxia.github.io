In dynamic and constrained environments, effective crowd navigation remains a significant challenge, particularly when deploying reinforcement learning (RL) policies from simulated to real-world scenarios. This study explores the feasibility of using RL-based approaches for crowd navigation, focusing on strategies to mitigate the challenges of transferring policies from simulation to real-world applications.
