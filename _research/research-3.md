title: "High-Performance Fault Tolerant Communication Protocols in Safety-Critical Industry"
excerpt: "<p> SmartNICs have become increasingly used to support intensive data center operations in the cloud computing industry. Today, SmartNICs are used to perform high-data-rate as well as computationally heavy tasks such as load balancing, DNS filtering, and implementing firewalls for intrusion detection. However, SmartNICs have not been explored to support use cases of resiliency that are often seen in safety-critical industries such as the Power Grid and Industrial Automation. This research aims to evaluate the feasibility of using SmartNICs to support safety-critical applications, such as fault-tolerant routing and cryptographical operations. </p>"

SmartNICs have become increasingly used to support intensive data center operations in the cloud computing industry. Today, SmartNICs are used to perform high-data-rate as well as computationally heavy tasks such as load balancing, DNS filtering, and implementing firewalls for intrusion detection. However, SmartNICs have not been explored to support use cases of resiliency that are often seen in safety-critical industries such as the Power Grid and Industrial Automation. This research aims to evaluate the feasibility of using SmartNICs to support safety-critical applications, such as fault-tolerant routing and cryptographical operations.
