The demand for advanced video generation techniques has surged with the increasing application of artificial intelligence in multimedia and human-computer interaction systems. In this context, video generation models that can produce high-quality outputs with specific class or textual content are gaining prominence. In this research, we propose novel structured models for generating in-car hand gesture videos based on specific classes and explore the capability of generating new and diverse gesture videos, contributing to the growing field of automated video generation.
