I am a rising junior majoring in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), with a strong interest in computer vision, robotics, large language models, and efficient computing. My research is primarily focused on computer vision and robotics at [Human-Centered Autonomy Lab](https://thehcalab.web.illinois.edu/), advised by [Professor Katherine Driggs-Campbell](https://krdc.web.illinois.edu/). I also work on efficient computing and SmartNICs-related research projects with [Professor Deming Chen](https://dchen.ece.illinois.edu/) and [Professor David Nicol](https://dmnicol.web.engr.illinois.edu/). Additionally, I am very passionate about real-world applications and have contributed to multiple projects in computer vision, large language models, and software development at [Garg Group](https://garg.cee.illinois.edu/), ApeEpoch AI Team, and [SigAIDA](https://www.acm.illinois.edu/).
